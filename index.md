I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), where I am majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) and minors in three domains of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/), namely Machine Learning, Computer Systems and Theory of Computation.  

Currently, I am working on the [GeomScale project](https://github.com/GeomScale) under the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6649856422051840), where I am working on the problem of (approximately) counting the number of linear extensions of a given poset by calculating volume of the corresponding order polytope.
I have also worked in the [Computer Vision & Machine Learning Group, NUS](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml) with [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/ayao/) and under the mentorship of [Fadime Sener](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/people/m-sc-fadime-sener/), where I worked on the problem of skeleton based Action Recognition using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.  

If you want to collaborate or have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email. I am always interested in connecting with people :)

## bio
- **2021 -** Will be joining [DevRev](https://devrev.ai/) as a full-time engineer in the Applied Machine Learning team.
- **Summer 2021, (3 months):** [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6649856422051840) student, working with the [GeomScale](https://github.com/GeomScale) organisation.
- **Summer 2021, (2 months):** Research internship in the [Computer Vision & Machine Learning Group, NUS](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml) with [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/ayao/) and under the mentorship of [Fadime Sener](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/people/m-sc-fadime-sener/).
- **2017 - 2021:** Bachelor of Technology at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) with a major in Electrical Engineering and three minors in Computer Science. This was an amazing experience for me, as this exposed me to various domains of computer science and engineering.
    - **May 2020 - July 2020:** Summer Analyst at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/worldwide/india/).
    - **May 2019 - July 2019:** Software Engineering intern at [CodeChef](https://codechef.com).

## pet projects
- [pygpbo](https://github.com/vaithak/pygpbo): a library for doing constrained bayesian optimization, it also contains methods for high dimensional bayesian optimization using linear projections (like REMBO, Alebo) etc. It was written as a course project during my undergraduation. 
- [Sudoku-Image-Solver](https://github.com/vaithak/Sudoku-Image-Solver): this can be considered as one of my first projects for full stack machine learning, this involved training and building the model, using it for inference at run time, adding wrappers around it to display the results, giving the user an option to correct the model output and finally deploying the application. For testing purposes, I used my own [Sudoku-Generator](https://github.com/vaithak/Sudoku-Generator).
- [Wind-Farm layout optimization](https://github.com/vaithak/Wind_Farm_Layout_Optimization): this was done as for a hackathon organised by Shell.ai, the problem was properly arranging wind turbines in a field as to maximize energy output using computer simulations. This involed understanding about the wake effect in a wind farm; we tried to solve the optimization problem using genetic algorithms.
- [smbt](https://github.com/vaithak/smbt): a small utility written in applescript for macos, it helps to save all the opened tabs (link and title) of the browser into a text file, which can all be opened again simultaneously.   
- [Connect4 - AI](https://github.com/vaithak/Connect4_AI): a browser based game of Connect 4 with the features of playing against another human, observing a game, chat messages and an option to play against an AI. The frontend is a bit laggy and written in vanilla js, backend was written in python using django mainly because of it's websockets library. A heuristic and search based AI was written in C++ and then ported to python.

## miscellaneous
- I love to play football and cricket during my free time.
- I used to love reading fiction genre books as a child, I am trying to rebuild that interest and enthusiasm for the non-fiction ones. I have started maintaining [my booklist on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30560993-vaibhav-thakkar).
- In my free time, I like to watch documentaries and read articles which enhances understanding of human psychology, this can be either related to interviews with people linked with serious criminal activities, social experiments or debates on topics like technology or religion.
