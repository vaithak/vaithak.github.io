I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), where I am majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) and minors in three domains of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/), namely Machine Learning, Computer Systems and Theory of Computation.  

Currently, I am working on the [GeomScale project](https://github.com/GeomScale) under the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6649856422051840), where I am working on the problem of (approximately) counting the number of linear extensions of a given poset by calculating volume of the corresponding order polytope.
I have also worked in the [Computer Vision & Machine Learning Group, NUS](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml) with [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/ayao/) and under the mentorship of [Fadime Sener](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/people/m-sc-fadime-sener/), where I worked on the problem of skeleton based Action Recognition using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.  

If you want to collaborate or have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email. I am always interested in connecting with people :)

## miscellaneous
- I love to play football and cricket during my free time.
- I used to love reading fiction genre books as a child, I am trying to rebuild that interest and enthusiasm for the non-fiction ones. I have started maintaining [my booklist on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30560993-vaibhav-thakkar).
- In my free time, I like to watch documentaries and read articles which enhances understanding of human psychology, this can be either related to interviews with people linked with serious criminal activities, social experiments or debates on topics like technology or religion.
