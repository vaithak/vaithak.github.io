I am currently a senior undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), where I am majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) and minors in three domains of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/), namely Machine Learning, Computer Systems and Theory of Computation.  

Currently, I am working on the [GeomScale project](https://github.com/GeomScale) under the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6649856422051840).   
I have also worked in the [Computer Vision & Machine Learning Group, NUS](https://sites.google.com/comp.nus.edu.sg/cvml) with [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/ayao/) and under the mentorship of [Fadime Sener](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/people/m-sc-fadime-sener/), where I worked on the problem of skeleton based Action Recognition using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.  

If you want to collaborate/have any questions fell free to shoot me an email. I am always interested in connecting with people :)
